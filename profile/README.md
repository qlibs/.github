## Qlibs++ - Modern C++ libraries

> ### Mission

- #### Quality

  - C++20+ ([gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org), [clang](https://clang.llvm.org), [msvc](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus)\*)
  - Compile-time self testing (can be disabled with `-DNTEST`)
  - Compiles cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fsantize=memory/undefined | /WX /W4`
  - Focused on composability and declarativeness (easy to use hard to misuse)

- #### Performance

  - Compile-time driven optimizations
  - Arch\* driven optimizations and benchmarks (No `virtual`, No `RTTI`)
  - Optimized compilation times

- #### Simplicity

  - Single header/module (including `documentation` and `tests`)
  - Single purpose ([unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy))
  - Minimal dependencies (none or [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library)*)
  - Minimal API (available on https://compiler-explorer.com)
